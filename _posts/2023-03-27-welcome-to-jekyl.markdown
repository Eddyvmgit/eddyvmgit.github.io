Below is a series of interactive plots that provide a more comprehensive summary of each of the 10 clusters that were shown in the map. Each pair of plots corresponds to a specific intersection on the map, allowing for detailed exploration of the contributing factors and consequences of the accidents and their development over time. As these plots are interactive, we want to emphasise the reader to explore the underlying patterns on his own. 

We can see that each cluster has its distinct distribution of accident causes. For example, the intersection 1163, 34 and 816, have had a higher rate of accidents due to cars following and passing too closely in recent years. Here, an easy solution would be a street sign warning drivers in regard to that. Cluster 707, includes a lot of accidents due to unsafe speed, where a speed limit could be handy. Cluster 5433 and 1483, have a lot of accidents due to driver inattention and distraction, and we expect that related awareness signs could be a solution to this problem. Thus, by comparing these details across different locations, we can gain insights into the variations and trends in injury patterns, helping to identify areas of concern and potential factors contributing to the severity of accidents in specific places. This analysis enables us to assess the effectiveness of safety measures and prioritise targeted interventions to reduce injuries and enhance road safety in different areas of New York.
