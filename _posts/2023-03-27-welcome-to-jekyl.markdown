As we scrolled through the pages the other day, we saw the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and all the voices seemed to be telling us a new financial crisis was coming. So we searched curiously for news about the serious, global financial crisis of 2008, and in it, we came across this interesting story from Washington (Reuters). In the article, the U.S. police chief said that "the recession is fueling a rise in crime" and mentioned that "the link between crime and the economy has long been controversial. "This makes us even more curious about this crime data for San Francisco, and whether gentrification causes relevant changes in a region.

In a further search on San Francisco's development, we found that in 2012, San Francisco released the Central Market Economics Strategy, which mentioned plans to redevelop the Central Market and adjacent land in the downtown area. Shortly thereafter, in early 2013, the San Francisco News published a story stating that "San Francisco's crime rate has reached a five-year high". And the article stated, "The Southern area has also been transformed and enriched by the city's booming tech sector, which has helped lower the city's unemployment rate to 5.3 percent." This raises even more curiosity about the growth of the city, the growth of the industry on how people live and the crime situation.

Combining the information from the articles we searched, we wanted to be able to classify the data by time and geographic location according to the degree of gentrification, and then perform further data analysis by comparing their heat maps. Based on the timing of the important events of the articles, we divided the data into three stages of gentrification, 2003-2007, 2008-2012, 2013-2018, and then grouped the crime data according to the different stages, and finally created an interactive heat-map below.

DISCLAIMER: COULD NOT IMPORT THE MAP AS A JS LIBRARY DID STRIKE! We included a google-docs link to the .html file

From the early maps we can see that there is a high incidence of crime in the downtown Civic Center neighborhood and near the intersection of Bryant Street and Harrient Street, as well as in the south near the harbor in the Kirkwood/La Salle to Oakdale/Palou neighborhoods. Comparing to the mid-term map, crime decreases throughout the exterior of San Francisco, with crime distributed in areas north of Central, but the area near 1C where BryBryaBryant Street and Harrient Street meet is still a high crime area. Crime decreased in the south, with no significant increase in crime near the harbor compared to other areas. Probably due to the presence of some technology companies in the south, the level of education of the surrounding residents has increased and crime cases have decreased.
